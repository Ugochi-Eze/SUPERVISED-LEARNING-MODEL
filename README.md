# SUPERVISED-LEARNING-MODEL
I learned about supervised learning by working with several models to understand the basics of prediction. I used linear regression to predict continuous values and logistic regression for classification tasks. I explored decision trees to visualize how decisions are made in a model and random forests to improve accuracy and handle real-world data more effectively. Throughout this process, I followed the complete machine learning workflow, starting from problem definition, data collection, and preprocessing, to model selection, training, evaluation, and improvement as well as deploying the model and documenting the entire process for reporting purposes.
